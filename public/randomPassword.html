                This project was a fun little 1 hours coding project because I needed a password for my github account
                but my usual go-to password generator kept giving me unsuported characters for other sites. Figured it
                would be the quote, un-quote, programmer thing to do to make my own.

            <h2 class="detailed-section-heading fade=in">Product Design and Infrastructure</h2>
            <p class="detailed-section-paragraph fade-in">
                Before this project, web design was not really my strong suit. I had done web projects and applications before,
                but I had never designed a full website from scratch without any input from my peers. I understood all the concepts
                but putting that into practice was a different matter.<br><br>

                I started by putting together a static version of the webpage. I used this time to scope out what ideas I liked and
                which ones I thought needed more work. It's important to note here that I was trying to be diligent in my usage of
                git and github here so there are lots of minor commits that don't make a huge difference to my codebase.<br><br>

                I learned lots of lessons about web-design, accessibility, animations and implementations of my own designs as well
                as thinking about the infrastructure of the application from the beginning. I had it in my head that I wanted to
                know where all my API calls were going to stem from and what HTTP methods I was going to need to get access to those
                elements. This aided me in the long run as I was able to identify the exact areas where database reading was going to
                be needed rather than trying to figure it out all at once across my pages later on.<br><br>

                During this stage, I decided to create a template for a portfolio project so that I could map out how that would look
                when the finished project was put together. This meant that I had a skeleton framework to look at and I could figure out
                exactly where it needed to connect to the backend ahead of time.<br><br>

                I also looked at deploying this website because, ultimately, I wanted it to be live on the internet as a functioning
                portfolio, even if that meant I would be coming back to change it in the future. This iteration of my portfolio is
                only the first, and I think that this page may be updated or changed as time goes on.<br><br>
