            <p class="about-paragraph">
              My name is Harry Perriton, I graduated in 2025 with an MSc with honours in Computer Science.
              My academic studies focused primarily on key development strategies, networking, machine learning
              and artificial intelligence. I found myself at university enjoying machine learning projects in
              particular but I am most passionate about making products that have a real impact on myself and my
              peers around me.
            </p>

            <p class="about-paragraph">
              This website is my portfolio; it serves to show employers and clients that my passion is something
              that I can focus to create impressive software products that are then deployed and used by other people.
              I am using this website to showcase not only my technical ability, but also my ability to understand and
              engineer a solution that works for the requirements being requested for the software product.
            </p>

            <p class="about-paragraph">
              As someone who has worked in the technology industry for years from a QA background - I know the importance
              of well tested code with thoughtful implementation. I am someone who is meticulous in my work and I have
              fostered a culture of excellence in myself that is harsh on my work so that the results stand to improve.
              I know that I am going to be a brilliant engineer, so if you like the work you find on this site, and are
              interested in getting to know me better or working with me on something - feel free to contact me.
