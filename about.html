        <p>
          I am a Graduate Software Engineer with an MSc in Computer Science from
          the University of Liverpool. I specialised my degree in Machine
          Learning and Artificial Intelligence and spent my last year working on
          a research project in this area. I have experience working with
          Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and can evidence my skills and
          experience with the projects located on this website.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion lies in developing innovative solutions and continuously
          improving my skills - as I already have a strong foundation in
          programming and software development, I am eager to expand that
          knowledge futher while searching for new challenges to expand my
          knowledge and skillset.
